# Note Taker

## The Short Version:
This works on the console alongside mySQL to keep track of employees

## More in-depth user control:
 * Utilises foreign keys and relational tables to track employees
 * View utilized budgets, update employees, view by department or role
 * Uses mySQL for the database
